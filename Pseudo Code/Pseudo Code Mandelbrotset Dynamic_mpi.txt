Master Process (P_master):

Initialize an empty 2D array image[HEIGHT][WIDTH] to store the final result.
Send the first batch of row numbers to each slave process, marking the start of their workload.

While there are rows left to assign:
    Receive a completed row from any slave process along with the row index.
    Update the image array with the received row at the correct index.
    Send a new row number to the slave process that just completed work, if any rows remain.

After all rows are assigned and received, send a termination signal to all slave processes
Save the final image using save_pgm.

Slave Process (P_slave):
Receive the initial row number from the master process.
While not receiving a termination signal:
  For each assigned row:
    For each pixel in the row:
      Calculate the complex coordinates (c.real, c.imag) based on the pixel's coordinates.
      Compute the color for the pixel using cal_pixel(c) and store it in a local array.
    Send the computed row along with its index back to the master process.
    Wait for the next row number or a termination signal from the master process.
