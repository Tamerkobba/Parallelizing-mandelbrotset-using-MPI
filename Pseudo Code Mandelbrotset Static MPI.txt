Master Process (Pmaster):
For each process (Pi):
    Send row number (row) to slave process Pi

For each pixel in the Mandelbrot set image (in any order):
    Receive coordinates (c) and color (color) from any slave process (Pany)
    Display pixel on the screen

Slave Process (Pslave):
Receive row number (row) from the master process (Pmaster)

For each pixel in the assigned row (for x from 0 to dip_width):
    Calculate the complex coordinates (c.real, c.imag) based on the pixel's x-coordinate
    Send coordinates (c) and color (color) to the master process (Pmaster)
