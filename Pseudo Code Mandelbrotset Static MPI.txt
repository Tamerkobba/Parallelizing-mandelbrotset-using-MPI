Master Process (Pmaster):
Calculate rows_per_process = HEIGHT / num_proc.

For each process (Pi) except the master:
    Calculate the starting row (start_row) for Pi.
    Calculate the ending row (end_row) for Pi based on rows_per_process.

Collect results from all slave processes using MPI_Gather.

Slave Process (Pslave):
Based on the received rank, calculate the assigned rows to compute (start_row to end_row).

    For each row assigned:
        For each pixel (x) in the row:
            Calculate the complex coordinates (c.real, c.imag) based on the pixel's x-coordinate and the row number.
            Compute the color for the pixel using cal_pixel(c) and store it in a local part of the image.

Participate in the MPI_Gather to send the computed local image part to the master process.
